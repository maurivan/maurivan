### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a designer living in Curitiba - Brazil San Francisco leading an awesome Design Team at Pipefy, making the processes in companies around the world even better.


Before, I worked as Design Lead for GVT/Vivendi, a telecom company that was recently acquired by Telefonica Group (NYSE:TEF) for US$9.3 billion.


In my free time I like to create awesome products, making smart stuff people love to use and interviewing a lot of awesome designers.
